    <plot>Everyone is sick of Fry living at Planet Express, so he is forced to move out to become Bender's roommate. The only catch is that Bender's apartment is too small for the two of them. After some searching they find a great apartment. A problem arises when Bender's antenna interferes with the TV reception. Bender decides to cut off his antenna so that he can live with Fry again. However he doesn't feel right without it, so he decides to leave and go back to his old apartment where he feels lonely. Leela convinces Fry to going back to the "small" apartment.</plot>
